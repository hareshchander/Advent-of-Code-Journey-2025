## 📖 About The Project
This repository documents my journey through the **Advent of Code 2025**, a series of algorithmic programming puzzles. I have set a personal challenge to complete this **12 Days** of the event, focusing on writing clean, efficient, and well documented Python code.

## 🌟 The Story & Acknowledgements

This repository represents more than just code, it is a testament to the mentorship and community that fueled my growth.

My journey into advanced algorithmic thinking didn't start in isolation. It began with the guidance of my mentor, **Dr. Zafar Shahid (Meta, California)**. His support bridged the gap for me, showing me not just *how* to write code, but how to approach complex problems with an engineer's mindset.

I also owe a huge debt of gratitude to batch of **Aspirants**. You all provided the environment I needed to thrive. You didn't just help me prepare but you also taught me **how to think**. You ignited a spark in me, a relentless curiosity and drive to improve that I know will never end.

This project is dedicated to that spark.

## 🎅 What is Advent of Code?

**Advent of Code (AoC)** is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.

* **Origins:** Created by **Eric Wastl** in 2015, it has become a global tradition for developers.
* **The Format:** Every day from December 1st to December 12th, a new two-part puzzle is unlocked at midnight EST (UTC-5).
* **The Lore:** The puzzles are wrapped in a whimsical Christmas-themed storyline (e.g., saving Christmas by fixing a sleigh, navigating the North Pole).
* **The Mechanics:**
    1.  **Unique Inputs:** Every user gets a different input file, preventing simple answer copying.
    2.  **Two Parts:** Part 1 is usually an introduction to the problem. Part 2 introduces a twist (larger data, new rules) that often requires refactoring your code or optimizing the algorithm.
    3.  **Stars:** You earn one gold star (*) for each part solved, for a total of 50 possible stars by Christmas.

It is highly regarded for training skills in **data parsing, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and mathematical optimization**.
