## 📖 About The Project
This repository documents my journey through the **Advent of Code 2025**, a series of algorithmic programming puzzles. I have set a personal challenge to complete the first **12 Days** of the event, focusing on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code.

## 🌟 The Story & Acknowledgements

This repository represents more than just code; it is a testament to the mentorship and community that fueled my growth.

My journey into advanced algorithmic thinking didn't start in isolation. It began with the guidance of my mentor, **Dr. Zafar Shahid (Meta, California)**. His support bridged the gap for me, showing me not just *how* to write code, but how to approach complex problems with an engineer's mindset.

I also owe a huge debt of gratitude to my batch at **AIspirants**. You provided the environment I needed to thrive. You didn't just help me prepare; you taught me **how to think**. You ignited a spark in me—a relentless curiosity and drive to improve—that I know will never end.

This project is dedicated to that spark.

## 🎅 What is Advent of Code?

**Advent of Code (AoC)** is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.

* **The Format:** Every day from December 1st to December 25th, a new two-part puzzle is unlocked at midnight EST.
* **The Mechanics:**
    1.  **Unique Inputs:** Every user gets a different input file.
    2.  **Two Parts:** Part 1 is usually an introduction; Part 2 introduces a twist requiring optimization.
    3.  **Stars:** You earn one gold star (*) for each part solved.
